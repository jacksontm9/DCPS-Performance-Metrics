# DCPS Peformance Metrics 

This project is an exploration of the District of Colombia Public School System's overall perfomance. For context, DCPS is classified as a large school system. DCPS publishes annual reports of several performance measures, but for the purposes of this project I analyzed PARCC assessment data, attendance data and enrollment data for academic school years 2017-2021. Using SQL I created ad hoc queries to uncover insights about DCPS's performance. 

#### PARCC Assessment (Partnership for Assessment of Readinesss for College & Careers)

Students in grades 3-8 and highschool take the PARCC exam to assess their comptenency in grade appropriate math, english and science standards set by the Common Core State Standards. For more information about the PARCC Assessment click [here](https://osse.dc.gov/parcc).\
I used the  [PARCC data](https://dcps.dc.gov/publication/dcps-data-set-parcc) published by DCPS for this project. I'd like to note there were no avialable data for school years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2021-22. I assume students did not take the exam during the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years due to COVID-19 restrictions.
